# Start-With-RECURSION




> RECURSION is a function that CALLS ITSELF.

Normally,A Function is a block of statements which gets executed on calling from the main fuction and also called from main function.

But,UNLIKE the normal functions the recursive function is "called" itself in the function.

SYNTAX:

    return_type function_name(){

       //Block of statements 

       function_name();

    }
    return_type main(){

    function_name();

    }

NOTE:
   The above syntax is based on C programming Language.The syntax may vary depending upon the Language You use.

> THE recursion can be supported by many languages.
> This repository is about simple and basic codes using RECURSIVE technique.
